![example image](example.png | width=200)
## Description
This is the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Each player takes a turn picking one of the squares. The first player to get three in a row wins. If all the squares are filled without a winner, the game ends with a tie. The 'red' player goes first. When one round is over, you can click on the reset button to clear the board. Each players score, including ties, is displayed below the board. A message is displayed above the board showing the current players turn. The cursor will also change color to that color.
